# Certificate-generator
This is a small python project for generating bulk of certificates in very less time(say, Time complexity of your code).

```
This is just like printing couple of names using a loop, but you takes those names from 
a exel sheet and print on a colorful template using the same loop. 
```

### Things to take care of:
- You need Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont module from PIL python.
- You need a Template, the kind of certificate you want to generate in bulk.
- An .xlsx File with all the names of recipients.
- A .ttf file of your favourite font.
- All in the same directory.
